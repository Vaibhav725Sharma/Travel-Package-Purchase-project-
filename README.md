This is the prediction based web application ,which will predict that customer will purchase your travelling package or not!





## First have a look at our dataset
    tourism.csv

## After a view of dataset
    travelpackagepurchase.py
    This file has all the source of how we analyze the data 
    (data preprocessing) ,how we select the 
    features(Featue selection and engineering) and 
    how we build the model and checking the accuracy.


##  Now lets build the front end of model using streamlit
###   Have a look at our file 
      modified_df.csv
      This is the dataset which has:-
      1. No outliers
      2. Only essential features
      3. No missing (NaN) values
      Fully cleaned data


### Code for model building
    travelpackagepurchase.py
