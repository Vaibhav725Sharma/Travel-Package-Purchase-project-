    (data preprocessing) ,how we select the
    features(Featue selection and engineering) and
    how we build the model and checking the accuracy.

## Now lets build the front end of model using streamlit

### Have a look at our file

      This is the dataset which has:-
      1. No outliers
      2. Only essential features
